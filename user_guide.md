## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the automated application work?

The system uses web automation technology to navigate job portals, fill out application forms, and submit your resume and cover letter, simulating the actions a human would take.

### Is it legal to use automated job applications?

Yes, but some job portals may have terms of service that prohibit automation. The system uses ethical automation practices that respect rate limits and simulate human behavior to avoid issues.

### Can I customize what information is submitted?

Yes, all submitted information comes from your profile. Update your profile information, resume, and cover letter template to change what's submitted.

### What happens if a job requires additional information?

If a job application requires information not in your profile, the system will attempt to answer common questions based on your profile data. For complex applications, you may need to complete them manually.

### How do I know if my application was successful?

The system will mark applications as "Applied" when successfully submitted. However, this doesn't guarantee the employer received it. Always check your email for confirmation from the employer.

### Can I apply to jobs that were posted more than 2 hours ago?

Yes, you can adjust the time range in the search settings to find older job postings, but applying to recent postings increases your chances of being noticed.

### How do I delete my account and data?

Go to Profile > Account Settings > Delete Account. This will permanently remove all your data, including stored credentials and application history.
